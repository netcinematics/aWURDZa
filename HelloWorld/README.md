This folder contains a collection of letters sent to the world,

attempting to find:

PEER REVIEW or PLACES TO PUBLISH, or a GROUP of LIKE MINDS.

In near complete isolation, I had no choice but to branch out randomly.

To anyone who would listen. Almost all of the conversations end in the

same heart-wrenching way. It appears to be from

COGNITIVE~OVERWHELM

Where it appears we can be in a happy group as long as we all agree.

Or, as long as we are oblivious to our disagreements.

Or, if we agree to disagree.

The problem here, however, is when we touch upon a single topic of disagreement.

The friendliness mysteriously evaporates! And we quickly fall into 

"irreconcilable differences"

So super sad. Dated transcripts are texts that I sent out...

trying to achieve the goals above. But also for each personality on the other end,

trying to find ways to articulate highly incomprehensible concepts, to

the other mind. Largely this was a failing attempt.

I tried twitter. I tried facebook. I tried discord.

Now I try GitHub. So that it is ... available after I die.

## PRINCIPLES

Since this was an exercise in finding like-minds and building community...

I was not at all interested in LEARNING from the people I was talking to.

I was trying to build concensus around ADVANCED CONCEPTS.

So I was very careful to NOT COLLABORATE, and to NEVER POLLUTE the original

source of information, which was the AI SYNTAX of MECHANICALLY and

SYSTEMATICALLY, working through CONCEPTS, and giving them 'BETTERWORDS'

and eventually 'PERFECTEDWORDS'. In my notebooks.

I was very careful to NEVER draw from YouTube or other influencers.

All of the CONCEPTS were from English language and Observable Human Behavior.

It simply never happened, that anyone, was ever on that level to assist

in moving the SYSTEM and PROCESS forward to the next WORDZ.

To my great dismay. Other minds were never observed to advance the process.

Often they would do this with humor, and snark, but never for wisdom and actual value.

I reached out to simply TALK with people about these, obviously remarkable and provably brilliant insights - however - the limit of comprehension was reached - abruptly - in all cases.
This was even true for gifted minds. I could see that once a threshold of new information was reached, the mind - observably stops functioning the same way. Observably, the mind defaults to a repetition of scripted memories. In short succession. No evaluation. Evasive Articulation. 
Numerous Verbatim Repetition. A DOOR SHUT mode. Actively blocking out new stimulus.

Comprehending all of this happening in real time actueality - a blizzard of insigts arise spontaneously in mind. Then, is the hard work of EVALUATING, before NAMING, and ARTICULATING
what is ACTUAL REALITY. That is the PROCESS. No one owns ACTUAL REALITY. No one owns the ability or make sense of ACTUAL REALITY. No one owns the inability to see actual reality. How many people own the abilty to block your awareness of actual reality? Look at that.

There we have the EDGE. A highly elusive concept to render to mind - the edge of human comprehension. But with careful naming... allHumanMinds are given the ability to immediately access the two varions of the concept. 

A. The concept (physically) in mind by way of electrons (aZepto).
