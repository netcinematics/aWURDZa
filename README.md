Artificial Intelligence project to Rhyme Words in C++.

It started as a "LEXICAL TOKENIZER", using "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING", an obscure branch of AI, suggested to me by a beloved professor as a graduate project. And it was fascinating!

Like most AI projects, the challenge seemed simple at first, even trivial, but then it turned into something entirely different!

And it was all because of one Professor, and a professional Architect who acted as a mentor.

## The Challenge

The concept was to use C++ to RHYME WORDS. That's it. So I asked my professor for a list of all words in the English Language.

Honestly, I thought he would balk at the idea. But in his characteristic way, he turned his head to the side, thought about it and said, "I'll get back to you on that".

Indeed he did! He returned with a brute force list of words that maxed out the 1.4mb floppy disk (this was just after the 90's).

And the Word-Rhyming Project was born!

## The Project Expands.

I didn't pursue a graduate degree in CS because - I found a great job that made great money!

But I kept up the C++ project... to this day (20 years later). In my day job, I was building C++ databases with DLL Modules.

So it was a PERFECT FIT for The Rhyming Engine. I shared the idea with my Architect at the time over lunch. To my surprise he was enthused with the concept.

He then introduced me to a more obscure branch of Artificial Intelligence... that very few people explore. Natural Language Processing.

I accepted his guidance, and began building a "Tokenizer Engine" in ernest.

## Short Details

The file I had been given from the professor, was now being iterated over by the C++ DLLS that were chopping the words into "Tokens". Then analyizing the words into META-DATA.

Original Meta-Data was "POSTFIX". And the intention was to start a company with the following mission statement:

> Generate Song-Lyrics that are More SINGABLE, MEMORABLE, CATCHY, and VISUALLY INSPIRING.

Which is how, gradually... with naivete... I began expanding to POSTFIX, and many more elegant CONSTRUCTS.

## A PC App

The company didn't go anywhere. Because I realised that the target market was... non existant.

Also this was before GitHub, and also before JavaScript Open-Source. So it went into hibernation for many years.

I still wish I would have written it in JavaScript because it would be a very powerful online engine.

But it is still a C++ PC app today. The reason why I bring it to GitHub, after all these years, is that it didn't remain an engine for creating song-lyrics after the company closed down. The engine kept on working. 

You see, because the mission statement was to make link words that are Memorable and Visual in the mind... the project crossed an invisible boundary into Human Machine Interface territory. 

Which meant, that the engine was operating at a much higher level than for just singable songs - and I didn't recognize it for a very long time.

## Conclusion

Dutifully for decades, I created new inputs and observed the outputs - then recorded the "PRINCIPLES" and the "CONSTRUCTS".

Only then did I realize what was happening. It was it was creating a new language. Something better than English.

As a hobbie, I let it continue for another decade, up until the point that I needed to realease it on GitHub.

And that is what this is. A placeholder for something quite spectacular, as I hope to go back to school.

A very interesting and actual breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence, using Natural Language Processing.

All thanks to a Professor willing to go the extra mile, and a C++ Architect willing to be a mentor.
