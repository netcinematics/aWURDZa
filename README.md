Artificial Intelligence project to Rhyme Words in C++.

It started as a "LEXICAL TOKENIZER", using "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING", an obscure branch of AI, suggested to me by a beloved professor as a graduate project.

And it was fascinating!

Like most AI projects, the challenge seemed simple enough at the outset, even trivial, but then it turned into something else entirely!

## The Challenge

The concept was to use C++ to RHYME WORDS. Thats it. So I asked my professor for a list of all words in the English Language.

Honestly, I thought he would balk at the idea. But in his characteristic way, he turned his head to the side, thought about it and said, "I'll get back to you on that".

Indeed he did! He returned with a brute force list of words that maxed out the 1.4mb floppy disk (this was just after the 90's).

And the Word-Rhyming Project was born!

## The Project Expands.

I didn't pursue a graduate degree in CS because - I found a great job that made great money!

But I kept up the C++ project... to this day. In my day job, I was building C++ databases with DLL Modules.

So it was a PERFECT FIT for The Rhyming Engine.
