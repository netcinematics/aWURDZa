SYNTAX of AWORDZA

Description - this is actually a pretty important file. It defines the characters that are used by the Lexical Tokenizing Engine to separate words and then to build more advanced "CONSTRUCTS". It is organized chronologically as the constructs were "discovered".

---------------------SYNTAX PHASE I--------------------


'*' - called a SWITCH.

Description: it was used to SOLVE RHYMING. So we could programatically define an array of switches to rhyme very easily. Like this:

RHYME: [ *tion, *sion, *cean]

For example, that would RHYME homonyms of NOTION, FUSION, OCEAN. See?

Put that in an OBJECT, and we have the 1st CONSTRUCT.

{ RHYME: [ *tion, *sion, *cean] }

The cool thing about that is that the SYNTAX could easily be a PREFIX and POSTFIX. Like this...

{ RHYME: [ co*, *tion, *sion, *cean] }

Which would result in random things like: commotion, consession, and crustacean. You get the idea.



## ADVANCEMENT.

It was realized that singable, memorable, and catchy lyrics would "paint pictures in the mind", much better if it not only used singular words, but also common phrases, called IDIOMS. Or as I renamed a broader group: SOCIAL~PHRASES.

That is where things really toook off!

I collected THOUSANDS of SOCIAL~PHRASES from across the world. Using various resources and techniques. And dutifully wrote them down by hand. Then entered them into the computer into massive txt files - systematically. For decades.

And out of this, a SINGULAR breakthrough concept emerged. It was called...

*titivity.

It was also a POSTFIX Operator.

That opened the door for HUNDREDS of other SYNTAX-OPERATORS. The smallest possible letters,
to assist in MAX~CLARITY.


## NAMING~CONVENTION

aWordza started as a Naming Convention from Computer Science, called CamelCase. 

It is a way to make VARIABLE NAMES by squishingTogetherWords and still being readable.

Turns out that is relevant for fixing flaws in the English language also.

## Little A prefix

At first it was small things like a lower case 'a' ("little-a") prefix defined ACTUAL. 
Which is a profound way to focus on what is actual, while avoiding flights-of-fantasy.
And off-topic forarrays into distraction, or difficult to disprove TwiztedLogic.

Then the misspelling of 'z' in place of similar sounds, helped to make regular english words
UNIQUE. Like the word 'choose'. I needed a way to make that word (and all of its twisted conjugations)
be readably... unique. Same concept, but of a PRECISE NEW IMPORTANCE.

So it became CHOOZE, and CHOIZE, and CHOZEN, etc. And is given IMPORTANCE, 
as a ROOT~WORD, as ~'aChoozea' - which was fantastically important meaning, of
actual REMARKABLE choice. A profound choice, or a thoughtless choice - with
profound consequence.

## little z postfix
The postfix (little-z), was also helpful in things like 

ACTZ - which specifies REMARKABLE human act or behavior. Short and obviously unique.

## Little a postfix

Similar to the little-a prefix, the postfix assigns a SPECIFIC MEANING - as ACT.

## Little 'o' postfix

 The little o means OBJECT. Or physical thing. As opposed to ACTION.

 This is helpful because it separates thing, from an act of such a thing.

 Example of Discouragement is shortened to aDissa. That would be deciphered as
  
   ~ aDissa - actual act of discouragement.

   ~ aDisso - would be a discouraging THING - like climate change.

   ~ aDissoa - would be the act of a discouraging THING like war.

   It turns out, this type of CONJUGATION is better at describing actual reality. Than english.
